This site is for demo purposes only but if you want to tinker with it you will need to:

Download it as a zip and upload to your themes folder on a Wordpress installation. Activate the theme in your Appearance settings of Wordpress.

A blank index.php file must be in your themes folder in order to run if one does not exist already (access via file manager of cpanel or filezilla).

You will need to install the advanced custom fields plugin (free).

Delete all pages and posts.

Add two new pages Home and About with nothing in them.

For the About page choose template as About Page Template (one of the options on the right of the page when you have the page open for editing in Wordpress.

You will need to create advanced custom fields, fields using the Advanced Custom Fields Plugin. Watch a short youtube video on how to use the plugin so you understand how it works. I have only added a few fields already, because this is just a demo theme, in the Home-page.php and About-Template.php but it is very easy to add more for yourself if you want to completely edit the contents of the theme.

Raise an issue here if you have any problems or can't get it working and I will reply within 24 to 48 hours.
